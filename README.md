<h2>What is FMCONVERTER</h2>
<p>FMCONVERTER is a Feet to Meter and Meter to Feet, python converter.</p>

<h2>How to use</h2>
<p>There are three versions of the desktop app (Windows).</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>fmconverter.pyw</b>: You can double click it and the app should popup without background cli screen.</li>
  <li><b>fmconverter.py</b>: If you double click this version, the app should popup with a background cli screen.</li>
  <li><b>build</b> folder: You'll find inside it a version that is in the executable format. It has the background cli screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you've chosen wich one you want to use, the GUI is straight forward.</p>
<p>You have the FEET label and next to it, the FEET box where you can enter a number. It has basic security so it will give you an error if you try to enter something other than a number.</p>
<p>In the same fashion, under FEET, you have the METER label and the METER box next to it. You can enter a number here to.</p>
<p>To convert a number, chose the box of the number (FEET or METER), and click the button CONVERT. It will give you the result in the cell you left blank.</p>
<p>The CLEAR button is used to clear all cells once you are done with your conversion.</p>
